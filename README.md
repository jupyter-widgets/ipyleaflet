## Installation

Using conda:

```
conda install -c conda-forge ipyleaflet
```

Using pip:

```
pip install ipyleaflet
```

If you are using the classic Jupyter Notebook < 5.3 you need to run this extra command:

```
jupyter nbextension enable --py --sys-prefix ipyleaflet
```

If you are using JupyterLab, you will need to install the JupyterLab extension:

```
jupyter labextension install @jupyter-widgets/jupyterlab-manager jupyter-leaflet
```

## Installation from sources

For a development installation (requires npm, you can install it with `conda install -c conda-forge nodejs`):

```
git clone https://github.com/jupyter-widgets/ipyleaflet.git
cd ipyleaflet
pip install -e .
```

If you are using the classic Jupyter Notebook you need to install the nbextension:

```
jupyter nbextension install --py --symlink --sys-prefix ipyleaflet
jupyter nbextension enable --py --sys-prefix ipyleaflet
```

If you are using JupyterLab, you need to install the labextension for ipywidgets and ipyleaflet:

```
jupyter labextension install @jupyter-widgets/jupyterlab-manager js
```

Note for developers:

- the ``-e`` pip option allows one to modify the Python code in-place. Restart the kernel in order to see the changes.
- the ``--symlink`` argument on Linux or OS X allows one to modify the JavaScript code in-place. This feature is not available with Windows.

    For automatically building the JavaScript code every time there is a change, run the following command from the ``ipyleaflet/js/`` directory:

    ```
    npm run watch
    ```

    If you are on JupyterLab you also need to run the following in a separate terminal:

    ```
    jupyter lab --watch
    ```

    Every time a JavaScript build has terminated you need to refresh the Notebook page in order to load the JavaScript code again.
