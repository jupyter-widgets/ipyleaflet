## v0.17.0

Here are some highlights of changes in this version. See the full list of changes for more details: https://github.com/jupyter-widgets/ipyleaflet/compare/0.16.0...0.17.0

### New Features

* Make it possible to use Choropleth layer with data containing NaNs [#972](https://github.com/jupyter-widgets/ipyleaflet/pull/972)
* Add Map panes [#999](https://github.com/jupyter-widgets/ipyleaflet/pull/999)
* Allow setting Map.dragging [#1001](https://github.com/jupyter-widgets/ipyleaflet/pull/1001)
* Add visible attribute to GeoJSON layer [#1002](https://github.com/jupyter-widgets/ipyleaflet/pull/1002)

### Deprecated API

* Deprecate LegendControl properties `name`, `legends`, `positioning`, and `positionning` [#979](https://github.com/jupyter-widgets/ipyleaflet/pull/979) and [#1005](https://github.com/jupyter-widgets/ipyleaflet/pull/1005). Update your code with the following substitutions for a LegendControl `legend`:
  * `legend.name` -> `legend.title`
  * `legend.legends` -> `legend.legend`
  * `legend.positioning` -> `legend.position`
  * `legend.positionnning` -> `legend.position`
  
  The `name` argument in creating a LegendControl is also deprecated, please use the `title` argument instead: `LegendControl({}, title='My Title')`.
* Deprecate layer and control-specific method names for Map and LayerGroup, in favor of methods that work for both layers and controls [#982](https://github.com/jupyter-widgets/ipyleaflet/pull/982). Update your code with the following substitutions for a Map `map` (or LayerGroup):
  * `map.add_control(...)` or `map.add_layer(...)` -> `map.add(...)`
  * `map.remove_control(...)` or `map.remove_layer(...)` -> `map.remove(...)`
  * `map.substitute_control(...)` or `map.substitute_layer(...)` -> `map.substitute(...)`
  * `map.clear_controls(...)` or `map.clear_layers(...)` -> `map.clear(...)`

  The inline operators still continue to work as before, such as `map += control` or `map -= layer`.

### Maintenance

* Compute the public path automatically [#988](https://github.com/jupyter-widgets/ipyleaflet/pull/988)

### Docs

* Document use of multiple basemaps [#971](https://github.com/jupyter-widgets/ipyleaflet/pull/971)
* Add a small introduction text [#992](https://github.com/jupyter-widgets/ipyleaflet/pull/992)
